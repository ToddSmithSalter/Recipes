## Ingredients

Serves 1

- 3/8 cup ground flax seed
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 banana (can be frozen)

## Directions

- Add all incredients to a pot and blend (I prefer using and immersion blender). If you're using a frozen banana, leave it out for now.
- Heat one medium-high while stirring constantly. Burning and sticking to the pot is likely if you don't stir.
- When getting hot, add banana. After the banana is getting squishy, blend again.
- Keep cooking until the consistency of a runny custard.
- Remove from heat and add fresh cut fruit, or other spices.
